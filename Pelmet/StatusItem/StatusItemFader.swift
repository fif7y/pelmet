// StatusItemFader.swift
// The one home for the Pelmet-owned status item show/hide choreography.
// SeparatorManager and ExtrasManager previously carried verbatim copies of
// this (identical constants, identical ghost code) — the timings here were
// hard-won against the agent's reflow behavior; change them in ONE place.
//
// Two-phase hide: the width-collapse rides the same coalesced bar reflow as
// the assertion swap (any later width change is a second agent animation —
// bounce and all), then after the reflow settles the item leaves layout
// entirely — zero-length items still reserve their built-in spacing, which
// reads as a dead gap next to the chevron. The glyph outlives its item as a
// ghost overlay fading at its old screen position, exactly how the agent
// renders third-party conceals.
