// PicturePassBatches.swift
// The pure side of the picture pass's follow-up batches (docs/PANEL-PLAN.md
// §8): which wanted items a follow-up is for, which drawn frames a follow-up
// may crop, what stops one, and when another round is worth its time. The
// pass itself (reveals, strips, covers) lives in TransitionCoordinator, and
// its first round does not use any of this to crop: follow-ups are a narrow
// fallback. Locked by PicturePassBatchesTests.
